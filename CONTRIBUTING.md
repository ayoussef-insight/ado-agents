# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to self-hosted-agents project! I appreciate your interest in contributing to my project. I encourage contributions of all kinds and sizes, and I value every contribution.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository to your own account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your feature/bugfix.
4. Make changes to the codebase.
5. Write tests for your changes (if applicable).
6. Ensure the tests pass.
7. Commit your changes and push the branch to your forked repository.
8. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

## Naming standards

1. Use descriptive names: When naming files, variables, functions, or any other entity in your code, use names that clearly describe their purpose. This makes it easier for other contributors to understand what the code is doing, and it also helps with maintainability.
2. Follow a consistent naming convention: Consistency is key when it comes to naming standards. Decide on a naming convention that works for your codebase, and stick to it throughout. For example, you could use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.
3. Avoid abbreviations: While abbreviations can save time when typing, they can also be confusing and make it harder for others to understand your code. Instead, use full words that describe what the entity does.
4. Use lowercase for file names: In general, it's a good practice to use lowercase for file names. This helps avoid issues with case sensitivity on different operating systems.
5. Separate words with underscores: When naming files or entities that have multiple words, separate them with underscores (_). This makes the name more readable and helps avoid issues with spaces in file names.
6. Use lowercase for bash scripts: When naming bash scripts, use lowercase and separate words with underscores (_). This is a common convention for bash scripts and helps make them more readable.
